# Authentication

Set `VAPPCLOUD_TOKEN` to an organization service token. The provider exchanges
service tokens for short-lived JWTs in memory and never stores either credential
in state. Prefer environment variables or your automation platform's secret
store over inline provider configuration.

VAppCloud resources accept references such as `secret_ids`, not secret values.
Any future value-carrying secret input must use Terraform's write-only attribute
support so it cannot enter plan or state. Short-lived credentials will be
exposed through an ephemeral resource rather than a persisted data source.
