  Migrate provider authentication to temporary role credentials and SigV4.

# Upgrade to v2

Provider v2 removes durable bearer tokens and static automation identities.
Choose exactly one temporary credential source:

- an Access Portal `AccessKeyId`, `SecretAccessKey`, and `SessionToken` triple;
- `credential_process`, preferably `vappctl access credential-process`; or
- `web_identity_token_file` with `role_arn` for CI.

Every API request is SigV4 signed. Credentials remain provider configuration
only and are never written to Terraform state. Resource schemas remain
compatible, so no resource-state migration is required.
